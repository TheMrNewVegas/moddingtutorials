# **Modding Guides**

This is a repository compiling all the modding guides I have found from various sources, primarily the [ROC Modding Tutorials Discord](). I created this primarily as a back up in case any of these very useful resources one day disappeared. Thank you to all of the authors who made these tutorials and resources as your time and effort is invaluable to the community.
